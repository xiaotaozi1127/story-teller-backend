Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Once upon a time, in the deep of winter when snowflakes fell like feathers from the sky, a queen sat sewing by a window with an ebony frame. She pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. The red looked so beautiful that she thought, “If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of this window frame.”
Soon after, she gave birth to a daughter with skin white as snow, lips red as blood, and hair black as ebony. She was named Snow White. But the queen died shortly after.

A year later, the king married a new queen. She was beautiful but proud and cruel, and she possessed a magic mirror. Every day she would stand before it and ask:

“Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Who is the fairest one of all?”

And the mirror would reply:

“You, O Queen, are the fairest of all.”

This pleased her, for she knew the mirror spoke the truth.

Years passed, and Snow White grew up, becoming more beautiful each day. When she was seven, her beauty surpassed the queen’s. One day, when the queen asked her mirror:

“Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Who is the fairest one of all?”

The mirror replied:

“You, my queen, are fair, it’s true,
But Snow White is fairer still than you.”

The queen turned pale with rage. From that hour, her heart filled with envy toward Snow White. She called a huntsman and ordered: “Take the child into the forest and kill her. Bring back her lungs and liver as proof.”

The huntsman obeyed and led Snow White into the woods. But when he drew his knife, she wept and begged for her life. Moved by her innocence, he let her go, telling her to flee deep into the forest and never return. He killed a wild boar and took its lungs and liver to the queen, who believed Snow White was dead.

Snow White wandered alone in the vast forest until she found a tiny cottage. Inside, everything was small and neat: a table with seven little plates, seven cups, seven beds. She ate a little from each plate, drank a drop from each cup, and then fell asleep on the seventh bed.

At dusk, the owners returned—they were seven dwarfs who mined gems in the mountains. They were astonished to find their home disturbed and a girl asleep in one of their beds. When Snow White awoke, she told them her story. The kind dwarfs took pity and said, “If you will keep house for us, cook, and sew, you may stay here safely.” Snow White gladly agreed.

Meanwhile, the queen asked her mirror again:

“Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Who is the fairest one of all?”

To her horror, the mirror replied:

“Over the hills, with the seven dwarfs,
Snow White is still alive and well,
And she is a thousand times fairer than you.”

The queen realized the huntsman had deceived her. She decided to kill Snow White herself. Disguised as an old peddler woman, she traveled to the dwarfs’ cottage while they were away. She offered Snow White a beautiful lace bodice and laced it so tight that Snow White fainted. The dwarfs returned just in time to loosen the laces and revive her. “Beware of strangers!” they warned.

The queen tried again, this time with a poisoned comb. When Snow White touched it, she fell unconscious, but the dwarfs removed the comb and saved her.

Furious, the queen made a third plan. She crafted a poisoned apple, red and tempting, poisoned only on one half. Disguised as a farmer’s wife, she offered it to Snow White. Cautious at first, Snow White took a bite when the queen ate the harmless half. Instantly, she fell down as if dead. This time, the dwarfs could not revive her. They wept for three days, then placed her in a glass coffin on a mountainside, with her name engraved in gold letters.

Years later, a prince passing through the forest saw Snow White in the coffin. Struck by her beauty, he begged the dwarfs to let him take her to his palace. As his servants carried the coffin, they stumbled, and the piece of poisoned apple was jolted from Snow White’s throat. She awoke, as if from a long sleep.

The prince rejoiced and declared his love for her. They were married in a grand ceremony. The wicked queen was invited but did not recognize Snow White. When she asked the mirror once more who was the fairest, it replied:

“You, my queen, are fair, it’s true,
But the young queen is fairer still than you.”

Shocked, she arrived at the wedding and saw Snow White alive. As punishment for her wickedness, she was forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes until she fell down dead.

Snow White and the prince lived happily ever after, and the seven dwarfs visited them often.
